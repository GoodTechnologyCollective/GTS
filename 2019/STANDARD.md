# The Good Technology Standard (GTS:2019-DRAFT-1) - Part 2

## Ethical Engineering Mantras: A good product/technology is built with the consideration for… 
* **Empowerment:** Product empowers its users 
* **Purposeful Product Design:** Is built to purpose 
* **Defensibility:** It is sustainable 
* **Considered:** Considers long-term social impact 
* [**Implements the GTS process**](IMPLEMENTATION.md)
* **Additional Checkpoints:**
    * Data Collection: It collects data in a reasonable way
    * User Product Education & Transparency: Its users and creators understand what the product is intended to do

## Checklist

### Empowerment
* How is the use of AI impacting users’ thinking and reasoning? 
* Does it assist humans or does it patronize them? 
* Does it help humans grow in anyway (personally, socially, physically)? 
* Are we empowering our users or taking responsibility away? 
* Do we offer a choice to users? 
* Does our product respect individual choice and individual preferences? 
* Do users feel that they benefit from using the product? 
* Does the product cause additional bureaucracy or useless time consumption? 
* Does it discriminate between users? 


### Purposeful Product Design 
* What is the purpose? 
* Does this product make sense? 
* Does society on a larger scale benefit from it in any way? 
* Could any feature of my product distract users? 
* Which feature could I leave out? 
* Are there more intelligent/efficient solutions to the problem? 
* Is this feature necessary or am I implementing it “just because I can”?
* What is the long-term product vision? How could it be used in the future? How can it be built in a way that allows for continuous use in 
the future (e.g., more computing power, different more complex software architecture)? 
* Intelligent by Design 
    * Use all technologies possible (new and old, including AI) to design the product, so it fits the purpose as much as possible 
    * Check for purpose in each step of the design process 
   
### Defensibility
* Are we unnecessarily limiting the product lifetime? (Planned obsolescence, software/product cannot be used stand-alone/will hard-fail when 
own or third-party services are unavailable) 
* For Hardware: Are we using lower-quality, more easily breakable materials to achieve only fractional/minor savings (e.g., cost saving for 
the sake of cost saving, while heavily impacting product quality and durability)?
* What is the product’s environmental impact? Are there economically viable alternative ways to reduce that impact? 
* Are there negative environmental effects when applied/deployed at a massive scale? 
* Do we rely on environmentally or ethically questionable suppliers/services or materials (in case of hardware)? Are there economically 
viable alternatives?

### Considered 
* Are there any negative long-term impacts of the technology/product to society if it would be applied to/used by millions (or even 
billions) of people? (Come up with future scenarios. Outline how they could be prevented, if possible)
* Does it take advantage of human weaknesses (e.g., causes addiction, abuses the workings of the human brain/perception)? 
* Are there certain use-cases/applications of the product/technology that could lead to dangerous consequences for society? (List them and 
put them on a “not-to-do” list with an explanation why) 
* Is there a risk of discrimination/bias if implemented at scale?

## Additional Checkpoints in Detail

### Data Collection 
* Are we collecting any data that we do not need for our application? 
* Can we realize the same application/precision by collecting fewer data points? 
* How privacy-intrusive is the data we collect? Are there different data sources/sensors that are less intrusive, but enable the same 
application when used creatively? 
* Are we collecting data without consent, even if it is not legally required to do so (e.g., shadow profiles, scraping, etc.)? 
* Are users fooled into sharing data using dark patterns/confusing communication?

### User Product Education & Transparency 
* Is the user able to understand how the product works? (Describe how the product is explained to the user and why that is sufficient)
* Is the user informed when decisions are made for them and can they understand why that was the case? (List which points the application 
takes decisions for the user and for each – how is the decision communicated/applied, how is it explained to the user) 
* Is the technology behind the product advertised in a way that it gives a false sense of what the technology actually can do or how it 
works (e.g., “AI,” Alexa/Google Home, “magic boxes”)
